# Shadow Stack and Landing Pads for Control Flow Integrity (SS-LP-CFI)

This repository represents an administrative repository for the Shadow Stack and Landing Pads for Control Flow Integrity (SS-LP-CFI).  
Here you can find the documents compiled during the Control Flow Integrity Special Interest Group meetings. These documents offer an 
overview of the attacks CFI tries to prevent (namely Code Reuse Attacks), as well as a short description of schemes and strategies 
that try to mitigate said attacks.
